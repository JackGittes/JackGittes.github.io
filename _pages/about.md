Bio
======
Mingxin Zhao is currently a senior software engineer in T-Head Semiconductor, who is focusing on CPU simulator, compiler, and other toolchains targeting RISC-V architecture. Before this, he achieved his Ph.D. degree at Institute of Semiconductors (CAS), during which his research interests included machine vision on edge computing chips, deep neural network compression, and software-hardware co-design.

Internships
======
- 2021/05 - Present, **Huawei 2012 Lab**, Technology Research Engineer (intern)
  - In 2012 lab, he is working on the auto-tensorization compiler techniques, aiming at compiling fine-grained user code to tensor-level hardware primitives via polyhedral modeling.
- 2020/10 - 2020/07, **SenseTime Research**, Researcher (intern)
  - In SenseTime research, he worked on building a flexible deep learning model quantization framework for bridging various quantization algorithms and hardware backends.

Education
======
- 2017/09 - Present, Institute of Semiconductors (CAS), **Ph.D. Candidate**
  - In ISCAS, Zhao is instructed by Prof. Nanjian Wu who leads a team developing vision chips. The vision chip targets ultra-low power near-sensor visual information processing. Zhao cooperates with his colleagues to deploy convolutional neural networks on the vision chip by low-bitwith quantization and structured pruning.

- 2013/09 - 2017/07, University of Science and Technology of China, **Bachelor**
  - In USTC, Zhao majored in applied physics.

- 2010/09 - 2012/10, University of Science and Technology of China, **Dropping out**
  - Mathematics
