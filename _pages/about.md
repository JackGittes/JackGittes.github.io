Bio
======
Mingxin Zhao is a currently Ph.D. candidate in EE at Institute of Semiconductors, CAS, Beijing, China. His research interests include machine vision in egde computing scenarios, deep learning compression, hardware-software co-design, and compiler techniques in domain specific architectures.

Interships
======
- 2021/05 - Present, **Huawei 2012 Lab**, Technology Research Engineer (intern)
  - In 2012 lab, he is working on the auto-tensorization compiler techniques, aiming at compiling fine-grained user code to tensor-level hardware primitives via polyhedral modeling.
- 2020/10 - 2020/07, **SenseTime Research**, Researcher (intern)
  - In SenseTime research, he worked on building a flexible deep learning model quantization framework for bridging various quantization algorithms and hardware backends.

Education
======
- 2017/09 - Present, Institute of Semiconductors, CAS, Beijing, Ph.D. Candidate
  - In ISCAS, Zhao is instructed by Prof. Nanjian Wu who leads a team developing vision chips. The vision chip targets ultra-low power near-sensor visual information processing. Zhao cooperates with his colleagues to deploy convolutional neural networks on the vision chip by low-bitwith quantization and structured pruning.

- 2013/09 - 2017/07, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China, Bachelor
  - In USTC, Zhao majored in applied physics that delivers the beauty and simplicity of the nature, encouraging him to turn his interest to engineering fields.
