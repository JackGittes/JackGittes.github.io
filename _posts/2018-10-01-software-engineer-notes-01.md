### 1. Software Crisis

Software crisis is a term used in CS for the difficulty of writing useful efficient program in required time.

Cause of s.w crisis:
- project running over budget
- demand/complexity/challenges increasing with same work force/methods/tools 

Solution of s.w crisis:
- Software Engineering

### 2. Prototype Model

Initial Requirements -> Design -> Prototyping -> Customer Evaluation -> Review and updation OR Development -> Test -> Maintain

Adv:
- Customers can see steady progress
- Useful when requirements are changing rapidly

So if customers change requirements rapidly, it's better to turn prototype model.  

Disadv:
- It's impossible to know how long it will take e.g. customers' decision changing
- There is no way to know the number of iterations it will be required.

### 3. Software life cycle model

#### 3.1

S.w life cycle model is a key concept of S.E.

It generally consists of series of stages. Like people, they join into kingdergarton -> primary school -> high -> college -> university -> job.

#### 3.2

Analysis -> Design -> Implementation -> Maintance -> Planning -> Analysis

S.w life cycle model is also called as process model.

#### 3.3 Why use s.w life cycle model?

To overcome s.w crisis -> using S.E. -> To develop a s.w product -> The development team must identity suitable life cycle model for particular project.

S.w life cycle model defines entry and exists criteria for every phase.

Without s.w life cycle model it becomes difficult for s.w project manager to maintain the progress of project.

#### 3.4 Different S.W life cycle model

- Waterfall model
- Prototyping Model
- Evolutional Model
- Spiral Model

### 4. Changing nature of S.W

The seven broad categories of s.w are challenges for s.w engineers:

- System software
- Applicational Software
- 

### 5. Waterfall Model

Waterfall model is widely used.

Adv:

- Simple & Easy to understand
- Easy to manage
- phase processed and completed one at a time
- requirements are very well understood
- clearly defined stages

Disadv:

- no working s.w is produced until late during life cycle
- high amount of risk
- not good for object oriented program and complex program
- poor model for large and ongoing projects

### 6. Spiral Model

It is combination of waterfall model and iterative model

Each phase in spiral model begins with design goal and ends with client reviewing.

S.w is developed in a series of incremental releases.

#### 6.2 When to use spiral model ?

- When project is large
- When releases are required to be frequent
- When risk and cost evalution is important
- When requirements are unclear and complete
- When changes may require at any time
- For medium to high risk project

Adv:
-
