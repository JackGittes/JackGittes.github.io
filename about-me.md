## Resume
- I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at Institute of Semiconductors, CAS. My research interests include machine vision in edge scenarios, deep learning model compression, software/hardware co-design, and compiler techniques on domain specific architectures.

## Internships

- 2021/05 -- Present, Huawei 2012 Lab, Technology Research Engineer (intern)
  - In 2012 Lab, I am working on the auto-tensorization technique, aiming at compiling fine-grained user code to tensor-level hardware primitives via polyhedral model.

- 2020/10 -- 2021/05, Sensetime Research, Researcher (intern)
  - In Sensetime research, I worked on building a flexible quantization framework to bridge various algorithms and hardware backends.

## Education
