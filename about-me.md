## Resume
- I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at Institute of Semiconductors, CAS. My research interests include machine vision in edge scenarios, deep learning model compression, software/hardware co-design, and compiler techniques on domain specific architectures.

## Internships

- 2021/05 -- Present, **Huawei 2012 Lab**, Technology Research Engineer (intern)
  - In 2012 Lab, I am working on the auto-tensorization technique, aiming at compiling fine-grained user code to tensor-level hardware primitives via polyhedral model.

- 2020/10 -- 2021/05, **Sensetime Research**, Researcher (intern)
  - In Sensetime research, I worked on building a flexible quantization framework to bridge various algorithms and hardware backends.

## Education  
- 2017/09 -- Present, Ph.D. candidate in EE at Institute of Semiconductors, CAS, Beijing, China
- 2013/09 -- 2017/06, Undergraduate student in Applied Physics at University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China

## Research Interests
- Edge Computing
- Digital Integrated Circuits Design
- Deep Learning
- Computer Vision
